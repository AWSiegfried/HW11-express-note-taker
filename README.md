## **Description**

The purpose of this assignment was to create a note take that allows the user to create, read and delete a note from a webpage. When a note is saved the note should then push to the database, therefor not requiring the server to remain connected to house all the information.  I used Express and MySQL to do this and then pushed it to Heroku to have a live website.  The part I struggled with most was the manipulation of the req.body dataset.  If I had more time I would add a longer, more-randomized ID generator, instead of just incrementing it by one each time.  I would also add in some more stylish CSS.
